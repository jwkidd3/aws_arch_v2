**Important:** Replace USERNAME with your assigned username (e.g., user1, user2, user3) throughout this lab.

## Checklist

### Task 1: Advanced Instance Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Launched base instance with advanced configuration: `USERNAME-lifecycle-base`
- [ ] Configured security group: `USERNAME-lifecycle-sg` (with your username)
- [ ] Applied comprehensive user data script
- [ ] Monitored instance state transitions (pending → running)
- [ ] Verified web server functionality and custom pages
- [ ] Tested SSH connectivity and system commands
- [ ] Documented state transition times

### Task 2: AMI Creation and Versioning
- [ ] Prepared instance with custom configurations and tools
- [ ] Created AMI v1.0: `USERNAME-custom-ami-v1.0` (with your username)
- [ ] Monitored AMI creation process (pending → available)
- [ ] Launched test instance from AMI v1.0: `USERNAME-ami-test-v1`
- [ ] Verified AMI persistence and functionality
- [ ] Enhanced original instance with monitoring tools
- [ ] Created AMI v2.0: `USERNAME-custom-ami-v2.0` (with your username)
- [ ] Launched test instance from AMI v2.0: `USERNAME-ami-test-v2`
- [ ] Verified enhanced features work correctly

### Task 3: AMI Management and Comparison
- [ ] Created user data equivalent instance: `USERNAME-userdata-comparison`
- [ ] Compared boot times between AMI and user data approaches
- [ ] Analyzed AMI metadata and relationships
- [ ] Documented performance differences
- [ ] Understood AMI version management concepts

### Advanced Exercises (Optional)
- [ ] Created AMI automation script
